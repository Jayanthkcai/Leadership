The bell curve, or forced distribution, is used to ensure that performance ratings follow a normal distribution, with most employees falling into the middle categories and fewer in the highest and lowest categories.

- Goal Setting: Ensure goals are set in a way that allows for differentiation of performance levels.
- Manager Evaluation: After individual evaluations, managers adjust ratings to fit the bell curve distribution.
- Performance Review Meeting: Explain the distribution and rationale behind the ratings, focusing on development for those in lower categories.
