Stack ranking is a method where employees are ranked relative to each other, typically from best to worst performer. It is often used in organizations to identify top performers, average performers, and underperformers.

- Manager Evaluation: After collecting performance data, managers rank employees relative to their peers.
- Performance Review Meeting: Use stack ranking results to discuss performance, justify ratings, and identify areas for improvement or promotion.
