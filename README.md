**Example**
A sports team where the captain helps the players work together, stay motivated, and win games. Here's a simpler breakdown:
- **Vision**: Knowing the team's goal (e.g., winning the championship) and sharing it with everyone.
    -  Coach sets the goal of winning the championship. They talk to the team about it, saying, "Our aim is to be the best team in the league."
- **Inspiration**: Encouraging team members to do their best.
    - Before each game, your coach gives pep talks, saying things like, "I believe in you all! Let's give it our all and show them what we're made of!"
- **Integrity**: Being honest and fair.
    -  Coach always plays fair and expects the same from the team. They say, "Win or lose, we'll do it the right way."
- **Communication**: Clearly explaining strategies and giving feedback.
    - During practices, your coach explains new strategies and techniques clearly. They also provide feedback, saying things like, "Great effort, but remember to watch your positioning."
- **Decision-Making**: Choosing the best plays during a game.
    -  During games, your coach decides which players to put in and which strategies to use based on what's happening on the field.
- **Empathy**: Understanding teammates' feelings and needs.
    - Coach notices when a teammate is feeling down after a missed shot and offers encouragement, saying, "It's okay, keep your head up! You'll get it next time."
- **Collaboration**: Promoting teamwork.
    - Coach emphasizes teamwork, saying, "Remember, we win as a team and lose as a team. Support each other out there."
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting plans if the game isnâ€™t going well.
    - If the other team is playing differently than expected, your coach adjusts the game plan during halftime to better suit the situation.
- **Accountability**: Taking responsibility for wins and losses.
    -  After each game, win or lose, your coach talks to the team about what went well and what needs improvement. They say, "We win together, and we lose together. Let's learn from this and come back stronger next time."


### Leadership styles
- **Directive Leadership**: This style is like giving clear instructions and guidance. Imagine a teacher explaining step-by-step how to solve a math problem, ensuring everyone understands the process.

- **Supportive Leadership**: Supportive leaders focus on nurturing and encouraging their team members. Think of a coach who comforts a player after a loss, offering words of encouragement and support.

- **Participative Leadership / Democratic Leadership**: This style involves everyone in decision-making. Picture a group of friends discussing and deciding together which movie to watch, considering everyone's preferences and opinions.

- **Servant Leadership**: Servant leaders prioritize serving the needs of their team above their own. Imagine a team captain who helps teammates improve their skills and supports them on and off the field, like a mentor.

- **Charismatic Leadership**: Charismatic leaders inspire and motivate others through their charisma and personality. Think of a public speaker who captivates and energizes the audience with their enthusiasm and passion for the topic.

- **Transactional Leadership**: This style is like a give-and-take relationship, where rewards are given for meeting goals and consequences for not meeting them. Imagine a manager who offers bonuses for exceeding sales targets and provides coaching for under performance.

- **Transformational Leadership**: Transformational leaders inspire and motivate their team by setting a compelling vision and fostering innovation and creativity. Picture an entrepreneur who motivates their team to pursue groundbreaking ideas and change the industry.

- **Autocratic Leadership**: These leaders make decisions without input from others. Think of a boss who tells employees exactly what to do without asking for their opinions, like Mr. Johnson, who directs his team on how to complete tasks without considering their ideas.

- **Laissez-Faire Leadership**: These leaders give their team freedom to make decisions. Picture a group of friends planning a party together, where everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to contribute and how to organize it, like when your friends plan a birthday party together without one person taking charge.
